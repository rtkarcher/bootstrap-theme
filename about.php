      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>I'm a full-stack web developer and Linux systems administrator based in Tuscaloosa, AL, and I craft websites and applications using the latest in W3C and SEO web standards.</p>
      <p>My current weapons of choice for development are WordPress and Bootstrap (my development capabilities and resume can be found in <a href="http://zerply.com/quizas/" target="_blank">greater detail here</a>) and I'm currently learning Ruby and dusting off Python to bolster my skills as an application developer.</p>
      <p>When I'm not writing code or pushing pixels, I enjoy playing drums, trying out new Linux distros, studying Chinese literature, and reading up on the latest research in neuroscience and biomedical engineering<!--, and constructing multi-story rabbit condominiums for my pet rabbit, Maddie.--></p>
